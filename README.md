Day 16: DOM Events in JavaScript<br/>

🌐 Day 16 of my 21-day coding challenge, and today was all about DOM events! Here's the breakdown:<br/>

🔔 Event Listeners & Event Object: Learned how to use event listeners to detect user interactions like clicks, and explored the event object to get detailed info about those events.<br/>

🎹 Keyboard Events: Covered KeyUp, KeyPress, and KeyDown events, crucial for capturing user input from the keyboard in real-time.<br/>

🖱️ Mouse & Input Events: Mastered mouse interactions (like clicks and hover) and input events for real-time form validation and dynamic changes.<br/>

🔄 Event Capturing & Bubbling: Understood how event propagation works and how to control the flow of events within nested elements.<br/>

Can’t wait to build more interactive features! 🚀<br/>
